myAGV PI 2023 adopts Raspberry Pi 4B core motherboard, with Ubuntu Mate 20.04 operating system customised by Elephant Robotics for robots, which is smooth and easy to use. myAGV 2023 is equipped with 2D mapping and navigation, 3D mapping and navigation, graphical programming, visualisation software, ROS emulation, joystick and keyboard control and other functions, which is the first choice for scientific research and education and individual creators. It is the first choice for research and education, personal creators.

- **Scientific Research in Education**

    - The myAGV 2023 series is equipped with high-performance planetary DC brushless motors, giving it more kinetic energy for more and more complex application scenarios, as well as dramatically improving the accuracy of auto-guidance; from laboratory research to classroom teaching, this chassis offers a full range of support to help you explore the unknown, and make research and education more flexible.

- **Creative Development**

    - The myAGV 2023 series has been upgraded on the basis of myAGV to achieve perfect backward compatibility, retaining all the functions of myAGV, but also adding a number of new features, such as 3D navigation, visualisation software, graphical programming, etc., as well as adding a number of optional accessories, which is even easier to use, and meets the needs of different users when carrying out the development of personalised scenarios.

- **Business Exploration**

    - myAGV 2023 series, can be equipped with our 5 kinds of robotic arm, myAGV 2023 + robotic arm = infinite possibilities, automatic navigation + machine vision + end-effector can simulate various commercial scenarios application, can meet the application requirements of complex projects. Support composite robot set, simulate warehouse logistics sorting scene, can be used for commercial pre-study and composite robot scene display, etc.
