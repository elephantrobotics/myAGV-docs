* Radar Off:
  * LED light control and test functions can be used 
  * Before turning off the radar, you need to ensure that the basic control, mapping, and navigation functions have been turned off.

## 3、 Basic Control

>There are two ways to control the machine move by keyboard and handle.

![Basic Control](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/basic_control_en.png "Basic Control")

**Predictions：** The radar needs to be turned on before turning on the basic control. If it is not turned on, a prompt box will pop up showing "Radar is not turned on".

Click the drop-down box to select the required control method, and click the button on the left to open. At this time, a new terminal will open on the desktop.

### 3.1 Keyboard Control

   ![Keyboard terminal](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/keyboard_terminal.png "Keyboard terminal")  

**Directional keys:**

Keystrokes    | Directions
-------- | -----
i  | forward
，  | Backward
j | Move left
l | Move right
u|Rotate counterclockwise

## 4. Map and Navigation


![Map Navigation](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/map_navi_en.png "Map and navigation")

**Preconditions：**

* Open radar
* Open keyboard control  

If it is not opened, a prompt box will pop up to prompt for the items that need to be opened.

### 4.1 Build Map

**There are two way for building map by Gmapping and Cartographer.**


![Build Map](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/build_map_en.png  "Build Map")

#### Gmapping

Click the drop-down box to select the Gmapping mapping method, and click the "Open Mapping" button to start mapping.

* Desktop display rviz interface.
* Select the opened keyboard terminal and use the keyboard to control the car. The rviz space will build the map as the car moves. The trajectory is shown in the figure:  ![Gmapping Map](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/gmapping_rviz.png  "Gmapping Map")

#### Cartographer

Click the drop-down box to select the Gmapping mapping method, and click the "Open Mapping" button to start mapping.

* Click the button and it will open a new terminal. If the terminal keeps scrolling the output data, the cartographer build file is successfully opened, and the terminal displays the following status:  ![Cartographer Map](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/cartographer_terminal.png)
* When the code runs successfully, rviz will be opened, and the map and lidar information will be displayed in rviz, and the red arrow is the direction of the car. The interface is shown in the figure.   ![Cartographer Map](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/cartograph_rviz.jpg)
* Select the opened keyboard terminal and use the keyboard to control the car. The rviz space will build the map as the car moves. The trajectory is shown in the figure:  ![Cartographer Track](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/catograph_rviz2.jpg)

**Limit:** Navigation cannot be used after mapping is turned on; if you need to use the navigation function, please turn off mapping first.

#### 4.1.1 Save Map

![Save Map](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/save_map_en.png "Save Map")


Click the "Save Map" button, and a new terminal will appear on the desktop to display the saved map information, as shown in the figure. The red circled part in the picture is the saved map file:


![Save map terminal](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/save_map.png)


**The default save path is in the software running directory.**

### 4.2 Navigation

![Map Navigation](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/navagation_en.png "Map Navigation")  

### Preconditions

#### 1、Copy and paste the saved map file into this path

 > /home/ubuntu/myagv_ros/src/myagv_navigation/map/

![File Manager](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/file_2.png)

#### 2、modify the launch file

1. Click to open Visual Studio Code in the top left corner to open the code editor.  
![vscode Icon](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/vscode_icon.png)


2. Open the navigation_active.launch file in /home/ubuntu/myagv_ros/src/myagv_navigation/launch/ path.  
![modify launchfile1](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/modify_launch1.png)


3、Replace the myroom2.yaml in line 5 with our own map file name map.yaml.  
![modify launch file2](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/modify_launch2.png)


4、Save the modified file and exit (VScode is more memory intensive when running, it is recommended to close VScode after modifying the code, otherwise the running carsystem will be very laggy, you can also use vim and other lightweight editors.)

**After following the above steps, click the corresponding button according to the desired navigation method.**  
**A Rviz simulation window will open. Note: It is best to place the initial position of the car at the starting position of the car when we build the map.**

### Adjust

If the car on the Rviz interface does not correspond to the actual car, click "2D Pose Estimate" on the top toolbar to adjust, so that the car on the Rviz interface and the realized car can correspond, and navigate after adjustment.

![Run launch File1](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/run_launch1.jpg)  

1、Click on "2D Nav Goal" in the top toolbar.

![Run launch File3](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/run_launch3.png)  

2、Click on the point we want to reach on the map, the carwill start towards the target point, and you can also see in the rviz a planned path of the carbetween the starting point and the target point, the carwill move along the route to the target point.

![Run launch File4](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.3/run_launch4.jpg)  

**Limit:**

* You can only choose one of the two methods: navigation and 3D navigation. If you need to use another one, please close the current one.
* Mapping cannot be opened after the navigation is turned on. If you need to build a map, please close the navigation.
