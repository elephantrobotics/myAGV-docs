## Chapter Summaryg

**5.1-System instructions**

Before using the system, you need to master basic Linux knowledge, such as file management and command line operations. In terms of network configuration, understand remote connection methods (such as SSH) to access the system. When flashing the image, select the right files and tools, and set the parameters correctly to ensure the normal operation of the system.

- [Customized robot operating system](5.1-SystemInstructionManual.md)<br>
The myAGV 2023 system not only has built-in environments such as ROS and Python, but is also equipped with robot development software such as VSCode, VNC, and SSH. 
No complicated configuration required. It also provides automatic update software and supports one-click updates for the corresponding development environment.

**5.2-Application Use**

For the myAGV series of products, we have introduced software specifically designed for robot applications and maintenance, which is available for our users. Among them, myBlockly, and myStudio are essential tools for users working with the robot. This chapter will provide detailed descriptions of the usage of these three software applications.
- [myBlockly](5.2-ApplicationUse/5.2.1-myblockly/jetsonnano/README.md)<br>
  myBlockly is a completely visual modular programming software that is a graphical programming language. myBlockly has a clean interface and comprehensive programming features. Its visual programming approach is suitable for users who are new to robot products.

- [myStudio](5.2-ApplicationUse/5.2.2-mystudio/jetsonnano/README.md)<br>
  myStudio is a one-stop platform for using robots such as myAGV. It is convenient for users to select different firmware and download it according to their own usage scenarios, while learning relevant teaching materials and browsing tutorial videos online.

- [myagv_UI](5.2-ApplicationUse/5.2.3-myagv_UI/user_manual.md)<br>
  The MyAGV_UI software is specifically designed for use with MyAGV products. It lowers the user's threshold for use through graphical interfaces, providing a quick introduction to MyAGV with just a click of a button. 
  It enables one-click startup for MyAGV sensor communication and SLAM , one-click LED light replacement at the rear, and also includes functions for testing motors and cameras.


**5.3-Firmware Use**

To ensure your myagv is always in top condition, we are constantly working to improve and update the firmware. Firmware updates are one of the critical steps to ensure device functionality, performance and security. By updating the firmware in a timely manner, we can fix known problems, improve functions, improve performance, and ensure the stability and security of myagv.
