# Navigation-Map Navigation

Previously, we have successfully created a spatial map and obtained a set of map files, namely **map.pgm and map.yaml**, located in the directory ~/myagv_ros/src/myagv_navigation/map.

![map_saver_2](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/map_saver_2.png)

现在，让我们看看如何使用创建的地图为小车导航。

- 1 Modify the launch file

Open and edit the **navigation_active.launch** file located at ~/myagv_ros/src/myagv_navigation/launch/.

```
cd ~/myagv_ros/src/myagv_navigation/launch
sudo gedit navigation_active.launch
```

![navigation_edit_1](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/navigation_edit_1.png)

Find the parameter "map_file" and **replace default="$(find myagv_navigation)/map/map.yaml"** with the desired parameter file for navigation. For instance, if you want to load **map_505.yaml**, change **/map/map.yaml** to **/map/map_505.yaml**. Then, save the modified file and exit. If you don't make any changes, it will default to loading the **map.yaml** file.

![navigation_edit_2](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/navigation_edit_2.png)

- 2 Run the launch files

After powering on the myagv, open a terminal console (shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the following command:


```
roslaunch myagv_odometry myagv_active.launch
```

Open another terminal console (shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the following command:

```
roslaunch myagv_navigation navigation_active.launch
```

![navigation_terminal](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/navigation_terminal.png)

- 3 You will see that an Rviz simulation window has been opened.

Explanation of the Navigation Control Panel in the Bottom Left Corner

① Maximum Number of Target Points: You can set the maximum number of target points. The number of set target points cannot exceed this parameter (but can be fewer).

② Loop: If checked, after navigating to the last target point, the robot will navigate back to the first target point. For example: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... This option must be checked before starting navigation.

③ Task Target Point List: x/y/yaw, the pose (xy coordinates and yaw) of the given target points on the map.After setting the maximum number of target points and saving, this list will generate the corresponding number of entries.When providing a target point, the coordinates and orientation will be read here.

④ Start Navigation: Begin the task.

⑤ Cancel: Cancel the current target point navigation task, and the robot will stop moving. Clicking "Start Navigation" again will resume from the next target point.

Example: 1 -> 2 -> 3. If you click "Cancel" during the 1 -> 2 process, the robot will stop. Clicking "Start Navigation" again will make the robot go from the current position to 3.

⑥ Reset: Clears all current target points.

![navigation](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/navigation.png)

- 4 Start Navigation

Set the number of target points for the task, and click to confirm and save. Then, click on "2D Nav Goal" on the toolbar to define the target point on the map. (Each time you set a point, start by clicking "2D Nav Goal"). The target points differentiate orientation, with the arrowhead representing the vehicle's heading direction. Click "Start Navigation" to begin the navigation. In Rviz, you will see a planned path from the starting point to the target point, and the vehicle will move along this route to reach the destination.

![navigation_2](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/navigation_2.png)

- 5 Precautions

**Note: It is recommended to place the car's initial position at the starting point where the car was located during mapping. If you need to modify the starting position, follow the steps below.**

Click on the "2D Pose Estimate" in the top toolbar to adjust the position so that the car in the Rviz interface matches the physical car. The terminal will then return the coordinates and heading angle of the car relative to the map.

![navigation_modify_startpoint](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/navigation_modify_startpoint.png)

Open and edit the "navigation_active.launch" file located in "~/myagv_ros/src/myagv_navigation/launch/". Find the "amcl" node, and replace "initial_pose_x", "initial_pose_y", and "initial_pose_a" with the coordinates and heading angle returned by the terminal in that order. After launching "navigation_active.launch" again, the robot's starting position will be updated.

# 2.Navigation framework and navigation principles

![move_base_1](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/move_base_1.png)

- move_base ROS node, which is the main component of the navigation stack. move_base subscribes to the navigation target move_base_simple/goal and publishes the motion control signal cmd_vel in real time. The various navigation algorithm modules in move_base are called as plug-ins.
- global_planner: used for global path planning.
- local_planner: used for local path planning.
- global_costmap: The global cost map is used to describe global environmental information.
- local_costmap: The local cost map is used to describe local environmental information.
- recovery_behaviors: The recovery strategy is used for the robot to automatically escape and recover after encountering obstacles.
- amcl: The particle filter algorithm is used to realize the global positioning of the robot and provide global position information for robot navigation.
- odometry source: The input is odometer data.
- map_server: The map obtained by calling SLAM mapping provides environmental map information for navigation.
- sensor sources: sensor data, usually passed into sensor_msgs/LaserScan 2D laser radar data or sensor_msgs/PointCloud 3D point cloud data, acting on the cost map to achieve real-time obstacle avoidance.

## 2.1 move_base 

move_base is mainly composed of two planners: global_planner and local_planner.

![move_base_2](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/move_base_2.png)

- Global path planning (global_planner): Global path planning is to plan the overall path based on the given target location and global map. In navigation, the Dijkstra or A* algorithm is used to plan the global path, and the optimal route from the robot to the target location is calculated as the global route of the robot.
- Local path planning (local_planner): In actual situations, robots often cannot strictly follow the global route, so it is necessary to plan the route that the robot should travel in each cycle based on the map information and obstacles that may appear at any time near the robot, so as to make it conform to the global optimal path as much as possible. Local path planning is implemented by the local_planner module, which uses the Dynamic Window Approaches (DWA) algorithm or the Trajectory Rollout algorithm to search for multiple paths to avoid and travel, select the optimal path based on various evaluation criteria (whether it will hit obstacles, the time required, etc.), and calculate the linear speed and angular velocity in the driving cycle to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles.

![move_base_3](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/move_base_3.png)

Let's analyze the `navigation_active.launch` file

![move_base_4](../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/6-ROS/6.2/6.2.7/move_base_4.png)

You can see that when the `move_base` node is started, many `.yaml` files are loaded. The meaning of these parameters is introduced below. The navigation parameters of `move_base` are placed under `myagv_navigation/param`. The main difference lies in the parameters of the local path planner. The base_local_planner local path planner is used as an example below.

Global Path Planning Plugins

- [navfn](http://wiki.ros.org/navfn): A global planner based on a grid map that calculates the robot's path when using navigation functions. Implements the dijkstra and A* global planning algorithms. (Plugin name: "navfn/NavfnROS")
- [global_planner](http://wiki.ros.org/global_planner): Reimplements the Dijkstra and A* global path planning algorithms, which can be seen as an improved version of navfn. (Plugin name: "global_planner/GlobalPlanner")
- [carrot_planner](http://wiki.ros.org/carrot_planner): A simple global path planner that takes a user-specified target point and tries to move the robot as close to it as possible, even if the target point is in an obstacle. (Plugin name: "carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner")

Parameter analysis

- old_navfn_behavior: If you want global_planner to have the same effect as the previous navfn version, set it to true, so it is not recommended to set it to true.
- use_quadratic: If set to true, the quadratic function will be used to approximate the function, otherwise a simpler calculation method will be used to save hardware computing resources.
- use_dijkstra: If true, the dijkstra algorithm is used. Otherwise, A*.
- use_grid_path: If true, a path along the grid boundary is created. Otherwise, the gradient descent method is used, and the path is smoother.
- allow_unknown: Whether to choose to explore unknown areas. It is not enough to just set this parameter to true. `track_unknown_space` must also be set to `true` in costmap_commons_params.yaml.
- default_tolerance: When the set destination is occupied by an obstacle, it is necessary to find the nearest point with this parameter as the radius as the new destination point.
- lethal_cost: The cost value of the fatal area of ​​the obstacle.
- neutral_cost: The neutral cost of the obstacle.
- cost_factor: The factor by which the costmap is multiplied by each cost value.

All parameters are default values.

In addition to these parameters, there are three parameters not listed that actually determine the quality of the planned global path. They are cost factor, neutral cost, and fatal cost. In fact, these parameters also exist in navfn. There is a paragraph in the source code 2 that explains how navfn calculates the cost value.

The cost value of navfn is set to
Cost = cost neutral (COST NEUTRAL) + cost factor (COST FACTOR) * cost map cost value.

The cost map cost value passed in ranges from 0 to 252. The comment also states:
When cost neutral (COST NEUTRAL) is 50, cost factor (COST FACTOR) needs to be about 0.8 to ensure that the input values ​​are evenly distributed over the output range of 50 to
253. If the cost factor (COST FACTOR) is higher, the cost value tends to stabilize near obstacles, so the planner will treat (for example) the entire width of a narrow corridor as equally undesirable and will not plan a path along the center.

Experimental Observation: Experiments confirm this explanation. Setting the cost factor too low or too high degrades the quality of the paths. These paths do not pass through the middle of obstacles on both sides and have relatively flat curvature.

Extreme neutral cost values ​​also have the same effect. For the fatal cost, setting it to a low value may result in no path being generated, even if a feasible path is obvious. The figure below shows the effect of the cost factor and the neutral cost on global path planning.

## 2.1.3 costmap_2D

The costmap_2d package provides a 2D costmap implementation that uses input sensor data to construct a 2D or 3D costmap (depending on whether a voxel-based implementation is used) and calculates the cost of the 2D costmap based on the occupancy grid and the user-defined inflation radius. The two costmaps require the use of some common or separate configuration files: the common configuration file (costmap_common_params.yaml), the global costmap configuration file (global_costmap_params.yaml), and the local costmap configuration file (local_costmap_params.yaml).

`publish_frequency`: Publishing frequency, higher helps RViz visualization.

`rolling_window`: Enable rolling window, local map is always centered on the robot.

`width`: Local map width (meters).

`height`: Local map height (meters).

`resolution`: Map resolution (2 cm per grid).

`transform_tolerance`: TF delay tolerance time (in seconds).

`inflation_radius`: Inflation radius, used for local obstacle avoidance safety boundary.

Plugin layer

`static_layer`: Load static map (permanent obstacles in the map).
`obstacle_layer`: Use the above laser scanning `/scan` topic data to build obstacle information and record obstacles. It is applicable to point cloud data.
`inflation_layer`: Inflate obstacles to generate navigation safety zones.

## 2.1.5 More Parameter Tuning Guides

The parameters in `myagv_navigation/param` will affect the navigation effect.

Use ros dynamic parameter adjustment tool

```
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
```

You can adjust according to your needs and observe the robot's motion status until the effect is optimal, record the current parameters, and modify them in the `myagv_navigation/param` file.

You can get more information about navigation tuning from the [Basic Navigation Tuning Guide](https://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Navigation%20Tuning%20Guide) and [ROS Navigation Tuning Guide written by Kaiyu Zheng](http://kaiyuzheng.me/documents/navguide.pdf).
