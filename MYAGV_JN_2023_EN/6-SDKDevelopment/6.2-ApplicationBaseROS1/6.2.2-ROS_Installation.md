### ROS Installation

- 1.Configure your Ubuntu repositories

Configure your Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse." You can [follow the Ubuntu guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu) for instructions on doing this.


- 2.Setup your sources.list

Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org.

```Bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

 [Mirrors](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation/UbuntuMirrors) | [Source Debs](https://wiki.ros.org/DebianPackageSources) are also available

- 3.Set up your keys

```Bash
sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

- 4.Installation

First, make sure your Debian package index is up-to-date:

```Bash
sudo apt update
```

Now pick how much of ROS you would like to install.

**Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended)** : Everything in **Desktop** plus 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception packages

```Bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

**Desktop Install:** Everything in **ROS-Base** plus tools like [rqt](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt) and [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz)

```Bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop
```

**ROS-Base: (Bare Bones)** ROS packaging, build, and communication libraries. No GUI tools.

```Bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-ros-base
```

There are even more packages available in ROS. You can always install a specific package directly.

```Bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-PACKAGE
```

e.g.

```Bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-slam-gmapping
```

To find available packages, see [ROS Index](https://index.ros.org/packages/page/1/time/#noetic) or use:

```Bash
apt search ros-noetic
```
- 5.Environment setup

You must source this script in every **bash** terminal you use ROS in.

```Bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```

It can be convenient to automatically source this script every time a new shell is launched. These commands will do that for you.

**Bash**

```Bash
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
