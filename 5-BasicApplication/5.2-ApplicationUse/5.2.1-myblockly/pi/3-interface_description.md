According to the above building blocks, the machine will do the following actions:

\- Set the machine RGB light mode to flash mode and  color to Red 255.

\- Wait 2 seconds.

\- The machine is moving forward at a speed of 10,with a default motion time of 5 seconds.

\- Wait 2 seconds

\- The machine is moving backward at a speed of 20,with a default motion time of 5 seconds.

\- Wait 2 seconds

\- The machine is spinning clockwise at the speed of 1,with a default motion time of 5 seconds.

\- Wait 2 seconds

\- Machine stop.
