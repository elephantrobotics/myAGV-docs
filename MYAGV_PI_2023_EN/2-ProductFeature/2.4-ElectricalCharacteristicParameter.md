#### 1.1 Switch : Power switch is used to control the main power input. If it is switched off, the controller is also powered off.

#### 1.2 Power supply interface of robot arm : banana plug female, model XT30UPB-F, to supply power to my series robot arm (12V 5A).

#### 1.3 DC/IO interface : The IO interface group is Dupont interface of 2.54mm, and 2.54mm Dupont wire can be used externally.

> **Notice:** 
> 1. I: As input only
> 
> 2. I/O: This function signal includes input and output combination.
> 
> 3. When the single tube corner is set as the output terminal, it will output 3.3V voltage.
> 
> 4. The source current of a single tube angle decreases with the increase of the number of pins, from about 40mA to 29mA.
> 
> 5. If a certain GPIO is set to the output mode and outputs a high level signal, the circuit connected to the LED is shown in Figure 2 , and the LED will light up.

#### 1.4 USB2.0 : Serial port with the standard of main line for 2.0 interface. The USB port is used to copy program files and connect peripherals such as mouse and keyboard.

#### 1.5 HDMI : The HDMI D-type port connects with the monitor.

#### 1.6 network port : Ports for network data connection. Ethernet interfaces can be used for communication between a PC and a robot system or for Ethernet communication with other devices.

#### 1.7 Power DC Input interface : Use DC 2.5*5.5 power port; The myAGV can be charged using the factory-supplied 12.6V2A DC power adapter.

#### 1.8 Standby battery port : Connects the standby battery

#### 1.9 Suction pump interface : connect suction pump, control suction pump work
